<p><a href="http://uxmag.com/">UX Magazine</a> has a book excerpt up for the new <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/">Rosenfeld media</a> book, <a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/book-excerpt-why-we-fail">&quot;Why We Fail: Learning from Experience Design Failures&quot;</a> by Victor Lombardi.  The posted chapter looks at Google&#39;s failed attempt to innovate communication - &quot;Google Wave&quot;.</p>

<p>The essential issue, he argues, is that Wave didn&#39;t sync up with any existing mental models for communication, so users quickly grew confused about what they were supposed to do:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The interaction was the most confusing. If your mental model of a wave was “waves are like e-mails, but they do more” and you were accustomed to e-mail interfaces like Gmail that offer robust search as the primary way of finding messages, the thought was that you could adapt to finding waves using search. Judging by questions in help forums, the biggest problem with this interaction was that people would lose waves. Someone would scroll down the list of waves and a wave that used to be there was now missing, often because they had recently entered a search term, narrowed the list of waves in the Search panel, and then forgotten they had done that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While, we&#39;re here, how about a shout out to the &quot;easier to understand than wave&quot; meme:</p>

						<p>You read that right, Japanese artist Kynd (Kenichi Yoneda) has been working on a project to simulate watercolor painting, inspired by the techniques of Bob Ross.  The project, programmed in OpenGL, has been iterating, starting with with the &quot;paints&quot; and getting increasingly complex and stylized. </p>

<p>Eventually, we&#39;ll have a sentient &quot;happy trees&quot; generator.</p>

<p>We always knew Bob Ross was a painting <em>machine</em>, but it never occurred to me that he might literally be a <em>painting machine</em> / &quot;time traveling robot from the future sent back in time to host a show on PBS and inspire the creation of a sentient painting program.&quot;</p>

						<p>It&#39;s almost been a month since launch, rarely a day goes by where some work on the site - either content or code or structure - gets updated.  You&#39;ve seen most of the content.  Here&#39;s a rundown of some of the code and structural changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added support for category / topic pages, and then...</li>
<li>Added scripts to generate <a href="https://github.com/gummesson/jekyll-vimeo-plugin">Vimeo</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/joelverhagen/1805814">YouTube</a> links, and then...</li>
<li>Completely changed the way the site is generating the category pages to allow for the Vimeo and YouTube tags to be read properly.</li>
<li>Improved the responsiveness of the site by wrapping the video iFrames for youtube and vimeo in a div that allow them resize.</li>
<li>Added the source code for the site on to .</li>
<li>Added the ability to include chapters / anchors in the feature articles.</li>
<li>Restructured the menu system by removing the superfluous &quot;blog&quot; link and added a topics menu to replace it.  I&#39;ll probably be playing with this more in the future.</li>
<li>A multitude of minor bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, I&#39;ve added the source code into a <a href="https://github.com/llthomps/ll">Github</a> repository for easy reference.  Thanks for your support, y&#39;all!  As always, <a href="mailto:ll@lloydsarm.com">feel free to provide feedback</a>.</p>

<p>One of the more valid points from trendy wave of anti-skeumorphism that arose up last year was the use of false textures to simulate real-life objects in software. The results, it was argued, confused users as to the true potential of a piece of software, and was really only useful for initial adoption.</p>

<p>But what if the texture could be simulated?  How would we use texture to design the way touch-based devices feel?</p>

<p>This TED talk covers a technology for recording and quantifying the way things feel when we hold, move and touch them.  Although the video mostly focuses on simulating touch environments in education and training, the companion article raises some other ideas:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Haptography has many uses. It could be used for online shopping by letting you ‘feel’ the material of an item of clothing from your computer...or as a way of allowing children to virtually touch precious museum exhibits.</p>

<p>One of the best UX books I&#39;ve read this year, is <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/make-it-so/">Make it So : Interaction Design Lessons from Science Fiction (Rosenfeld Media)</a>.  This incredible book takes the approach of examining the interfaces in science fiction movies as if they are fully functional, draws assumptions about what <em>must</em> be making them work (or not work) correctly for a user and returns those assumptions as distilled insights.</p>

<p>Through this process, the authors highlight the role that successful interaction designers play in developing a narrative for the users to follow.</p>

<p>The Make it So blog released a few new articles spotlighting <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113568/">Ghost in the Shell (1995)</a>.</p>

					<h3><a href='http://www.edutopia.org/blog/fonts-help-students-remember-read-jason-cranford-teague' target=_blank>A defense of Comic Sans ... (in education) <span class="icon-external-link"> </span></a></h3>
				
	
				<div class="post-text">
					

					
						<p>YES - I&#39;ve been searching for this article for years.  If you&#39;re like me, you got tired of making fun of Comic Sans in 2006.  I mean, Comic Sans is the &quot;that what she said&quot; of font jokes.  So, here&#39;s an article that argues that for elementary schools it&#39;s a scientifically justifiable font choice, and that your / mine aesthetics be damned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[The] research found a correlation between the effort it took to read text and the ability of subjects to remember that information for later testing. Yes, information presented in a &quot;harder-to-read&quot; font -- such as Comic Sans -- was better remembered than the same information in easier-to-read type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That said, this strategy probably does tax the brain more, which has tradeoffs of its own, so don&#39;t go start writing novels in Comic Sans, or really anything - the font is really quite ugly.  I&#39;m interpreting it more as &quot;Yay, you read a font joke! Do you want some actual information about the font?&quot;</p>

<p>This actually reminds me of an essay on <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/im-comic-sans-asshole">McSweeney&#39;s site written using the voice of Comic Sans</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don’t like that your coworker used me on that note about stealing her yogurt from the break room fridge? ... Sorry I’m standing in the way of your minimalist Bauhaus-esque fascist snoozefest. Maybe sometime you should take off your black turtleneck, stop compulsively adjusting your Tumblr theme, and lighten the fuck up for once.</p>

<p>Generally, when we hear about the uncanny valley - it’s someone talking about Zombies, Polar Express or a freaky japanese robot face. Translate - someone is trying to gross us out or they kinda fucked up. Artist Mike Pelletier has taken a different approach, attempting to dive in and out of the valley - creating things that are varying level of bothersome.</p>

<p>The uncanny valley describes an effect where humans can accept and respond positively to anthropomorphic forms up to a point. But when those forms start to get too close, our level of acceptance drops dramatically, and we can respond very negatively.</p>

<p>If you’re like me and scour the internet for multiple recipes to sort of “frankenrecipe”, I highly recommend this book. I just picked up a copy today, and haven’t put it down (I accidentally glued it to my pants).</p>

<p>This cookbook has no recipes, instead opting for 339 pages of what it calls “Flavor Matchmaking Charts” - an alphabetical list of every ingredient and a companion list of things that complement the ingredient, as well as useful advice from chefs. So, instead of asking “can I substitute ingredient X” and trying to find someone who agrees with you on foodnetwork.com, you can just look it up in the damn book.</p>

<p>Interestingly, as seen above, more complementary ingredients get more weight and capitalization, so lavender goes great with <strong>HONEY</strong> and <strong>LAMB</strong>.</p>

						<p>Shrubs - a thin syrup with a flavor profile somewhere between fruity pebbles and salad dressing.
They make a great addition to cocktails and to sparkling water (for a more complex italian soda). About three months ago, it was all the rage in cocktails, before it was displaced by Mezcal, then Averna, then crushed-ice cocktails, then cocktails named &#8220;swizzle&#8221;, and finally it&#8217;s regained the crown as a subject of interest in bartenders and cocktailinista&#8217;s for at least the next 10-14 days. While it&#8217;s still popular, I&#8217;ll take the opportunity to share what I know, and drop some links for those who might be interested.</p>

<p>A pretty amazing and coherent lo-fi prototype for the fictional website “bullshitreference.com” by <a href="http://ritabored.blogspot.com/">wasted rita</a>. I, for one, would use this site.</p>

					<p><p>Why should anything be simple? In this article, we’ll cover the most base topic and try and understand how people make a decision to buy a particular pair of shoes. Specifically, we’ll be looking at how the BRAIN facilitates the decision, the three layers of decision processing, and where we get confused and start making stupid decisions. Who’s down for some stupid decisions with me?</p>

						<p>Before I start into anything here, and I will ramble, let me encourage you to go read the <a href="/features/fashion/2013/07/28/shoe-decisions.html">actual feature</a> instead, if you haven’t already read it. This post is, even at its very best and most eloquent, will just end up being filler.</p>

<p>For a while, I’ve been wanting a place to post bigger pieces of content and random thoughts and I’ve simultaneously been really desiring to actually invest in a personal project and design something new from the ground up. By launching, I think I’ve accomplished both of these things.</p>

<p>So, now what? I’ve got a few goals in mind for this site:</p>

<ul>
<li>Post insights on some of the longer user experience and research projects.</li>
<li>Share some of the great places and finds that I run across in the food &amp; drink world.</li>
<li>Pictures of my cat, because hashtag, fuck it why not?</li>
</ul>

<p>From there - hopefully some evolution and then maybe someday a post that says “I haven’t posted here in a while” - as I’m pretty sure that’s as standard for blogs and tumblrs now as it was 18 years ago, when people did online journals.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting! Critical feedback, please.</p>

<p class='addendum'>PS - I haven't tested this yet in IE (I know). Part of me wants to add an IE style sheet that just says "psyyycchh - use a real browser, please", but then what would all the call center employees of the world use to look at my site? I'M ON IT, OKAY?</p>
