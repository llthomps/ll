LEGO:

+ Bring your architectural creations to life in LEGOÂ® form with LEGO Architecture Studio. In this amazing set you get over 1200 LEGO bricks and an inspirational guidebook filled with 272 pages of tips, techniques, features, and intuitive hands-on exercises endorsed by leading design houses.

The guidebook that the design studio comes with contains industry recognized architectural design principles with buildings and exercises to support each principle.

This kit makes me want to abandon whiteboards and start prototyping applications with LEGOs.  Note to the parents - "Hey, mail me the LEGOs, please."
