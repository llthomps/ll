You read that right, Japanese artist Kynd (Kenichi Yoneda) has been working on a project to simulate watercolor painting, inspired by the techniques of Bob Ross.  The project, programmed in OpenGL, has been iterating, starting with with the "paints" and getting increasingly complex and stylized.

Eventually, we'll have a sentient "happy trees" generator.

We always knew Bob Ross was a painting _machine_, but it never occurred to me that he might literally be a _painting machine_ / "time traveling robot from the future sent back in time to host a show on PBS and inspire the creation of a sentient painting program."
