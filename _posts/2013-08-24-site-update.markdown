It's almost been a month since launch, rarely a day goes by where some work on the site - either content or code or structure - gets updated.  You've seen most of the content.  Here's a rundown of some of the code and structural changes:

+ Added support for category / topic pages, and then...
+ Added scripts to generate [Vimeo](https://github.com/gummesson/jekyll-vimeo-plugin) and [YouTube](https://gist.github.com/joelverhagen/1805814) links, and then...
+ Completely changed the way the site is generating the category pages to allow for the Vimeo and YouTube tags to be read properly.
+ Improved the responsiveness of the site by wrapping the video iFrames for youtube and vimeo in a div that allow them resize.
+ Added the source code for the site on to .
+ Added the ability to include chapters / anchors in the feature articles.
+ Restructured the menu system by removing the superfluous "blog" link and added a topics menu to replace it.  I'll probably be playing with this more in the future.
+ A multitude of minor bug fixes.

Lastly, I've added the source code into a [Github](https://github.com/llthomps/ll) repository for easy reference.  Thanks for your support, y'all!  As always, [feel free to provide feedback](mailto:ll@lloydsarm.com).

PS - I still haven't done any Internet Explorer testing.  Eat static or use a real browser, [biiiiiiitch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LGEiIL1__s).
