YES - I've been searching for this article for years.  If you're like me, you got tired of making fun of Comic Sans in 2006.  I mean, Comic Sans is the "that what she said" of font jokes.  So, here's an article that argues that for elementary schools it's a scientifically justifiable font choice, and that your / mine aesthetics be damned.

> [The] research found a correlation between the effort it took to read text and the ability of subjects to remember that information for later testing. Yes, information presented in a "harder-to-read" font -- such as Comic Sans -- was better remembered than the same information in easier-to-read type.

That said, this strategy probably does tax the brain more, which has tradeoffs of its own, so don't go start writing novels in Comic Sans, or really anything - the font is really quite ugly.  I'm interpreting it more as "Yay, you read a font joke! Do you want some actual information about the font?"

This actually reminds me of an essay on [McSweeney's site written using the voice of Comic Sans](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/im-comic-sans-asshole):

> You don’t like that your coworker used me on that note about stealing her yogurt from the break room fridge? ... Sorry I’m standing in the way of your minimalist Bauhaus-esque fascist snoozefest. Maybe sometime you should take off your black turtleneck, stop compulsively adjusting your Tumblr theme, and lighten the fuck up for once.

Chill dude, we're over it - see? [It's the London Olympics font](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1665318/the-8-worst-fonts-in-the-world).
