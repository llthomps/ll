Before I start into anything here, and I will ramble, let me encourage you to go read the [actual feature]({% post_url 2013-07-28-shoe-decisions %}) instead, if you haven’t already read it. This post is, even at its very best and most eloquent, will just end up being filler.

For a while, I’ve been wanting a place to post bigger pieces of content and random thoughts and I’ve simultaneously been really desiring to actually invest in a personal project and design something new from the ground up. By launching, I think I’ve accomplished both of these things.

So, now what? I’ve got a few goals in mind for this site:

+ Post insights on some of the longer user experience and research projects.
+ Share some of the great places and finds that I run across in the food & drink world.
+ Pictures of my cat, because hashtag, fuck it why not?

From there - hopefully some evolution and then maybe someday a post that says “I haven’t posted here in a while” - as I’m pretty sure that’s as standard for blogs and tumblrs now as it was 18 years ago, when people did online journals.

Thanks for visiting! Critical feedback, please.

<p class='addendum'>PS - I haven't tested this yet in IE (I know). Part of me wants to add an IE style sheet that just says "psyyycchh - use a real browser, please", but then what would all the call center employees of the world use to look at my site? I'M ON IT, OKAY?</p>
