**Telepathy.  ESP.  Divination. The Tarot.  In this article we'll explore the strange history of utilizing the Tarot readings in project ideation and strategy in an article where we explore design methods of the occult, abandoned because of their inherit power.** 

Thanks for getting past the lead.  It's completely false.  We'll be exploring how to utilize a classic divination technique that's highly dependent on subjective input from the "querent" and facilitator to help individuals on a project engage in divergent and creative thinking.  And let's be clear about this - I don't think the Tarot Cards are an accurate way to predict anything, in real life.  

What I do think is that they're a great way to force people to make connections that aren't immediately obvious.  When we apply this in real-life, we rightly call it things like "paranoia", but when we use it in a controlled environment it can be a very useful tool for helping people be creative, get past stonewalls in their thinking, and expand their understanding of a situation.

<span id="section1"> </span>
### The rules

The reading has three phases - the reading itself, a discussion of key themes in the reading, and the generation of actions or follow-up questions.  As always, address your goals up front.  It's important to make clear that you're relying on their interpretation, and that you don't expect the cards to influence or predict anything.

+ The reading itself only has one rule - that **all cards played must have a coherent interprentation**.  Discuss the meaining of the card placement up-front, and then read the meaning for each card aloud and allow the team to interpret that into how it applies to the project.  The Tarot generally has two subjects it addresses - the situation or question and the querent / subject of the reading.  For the the Tarot method, this can be abstracted as the facilitator sees fit.
+ As the team works throughout the questions, the facilitator should **take note of surprises and themes that pop up frequently**.  Try and grab 3+ of these themes.  When the reading is over, open up each of these themes for a general discussion.  At this point, you'll want to keep discussion broad.  The discussion should start to narrow and as it does and begins to move towards tactics to address the issue, it's probably time to capture those actions move on to the next topic.
+ The last part is the distillation. Each discussion item should ideally **produce a list of follow-ups and actions**.  Review those with the team and try and identify the DRI (directly responsible individual).

In my experience, participants will often want to conduct multiple readings, as they find the experience fun.  I'd recommend against multiple readings in a single sitting, as the larger group seems to lose interest part-way through a second reading, and will start calling BS on cards that seem to be a non-sequitur.

To be useful, this method really does require both a querent and a facilitator.  Single-person readings can result in the querent fishing for a single answer, and ignoring the "why is this relevant" question that comes with each card.

#### When it's useful
I've found this method useful both early and late in a project.  If used early, expect to address strategic issues and key players.  Late in the project, this  method can help think through intractable issues or delays.  Finally, during launch, this method can be used as a fun way to help recast some of the trials over the design or development period and help your team project their expectations for the product.  

##### This technique can be utilized internally to read project teams...
I've applied this method with programmers, who after focusing through complicated, logical issues all day, can justifiably have some trouble tapping into their creativity with the cognitive load they've endured coding.  The reality is that almost all of the coders I know are incredibly creative, and this technique can help them back off and start to embrace the whole picture.

##### ...or externally to query on behalf of customers
One technique we've utilized is to do a reading on the behalf of a fictional user, or a persona.  Personas usually have motivations, objectives, and key behaviors.  


#### What to expect
This method will produce a mix of macro and micro items to address.  To some extent, it is dependent on the cards - which will be interpreted as people or forces.  As always, people should be addressed according to their needs, and forces addressed according to their momentum.

##### Be prepared for the _unexpected_
Expect at least one non-sequitur surprise and one "I knew it!" card to appear.  Be prepared to twist the surprise into a discussion on why it's unexpected and what the surprise implies.  I find it's best to use the "I knew it!" as an opportunity to flow through the exercise more quickly, rather than rehashing a discussion for the second time.

##### Keep the questions & topics broad
Simple, straightforward questions like "will we meet our deadline?" can produce non-sensical answers.  A deadline is a valuable consideration, but 10 cards about a deadline is too much information.  Get the team to broaden the topic to something like "the state of the project" and then look for answers about the deadline.

### Case study: Microsoft's Pathway after the Surface Debacle

In order to demonstrate, I've picked a popular topic with a clear narrative.  Hopefully this will demonstrate how we can use the cards not just to find obvious answers, but explore all the nuances of the situation.  If we succeed, we'll end up with something that's about as high quality as most of the bullshit that's out there now.

This is probably a good time to bring up that I work for Apple, and mention that my opinions and the opinions of the company are entirely independent entities, and I am in no way speaking for Apple, even if I obviously should<sup>n't</sup> be.  Am I biased?  Absolutely - in fact I'm counting on it.

_"Now, I need you to clear your mind and focus on the topic you've chosen. As you draw each card, repeat the topic to yourself in your head.  The Tarot can sometimes be mysterious, sometimes we have to look beyond ourselves for answers, so you know ... this is all BS right?  The further you stretch each card the better."_

---------------------------------------

##### Card 1 - The heart of the matter / The question - The Magician
<aside class="tarot pull-right">
![The Magician](/img/tarot-feature/cards/the-magician.jpg "tarot")
</aside>

WOW.  I cannot describe to you what an amazingly fascinating card this is to pull first.  Let me try anyways, or this article is going to be hard to read.  

This card represents supreme talent and a holistic control of the world, with a touch of divine providence with the wand reached to the heavens and the infinity symbol above the Magician's head
 
In spite all of Microsoft's troubles, and _alleged_ increasing irrelevance, they still are a giant force in tech - employing loads of talented people, and still capable of moving the needle of tech - both when they succeed and even when they fail.  As an example, the Surface and Windows 8 are widely regarded as duds at this point, but the Microsoft aesthetic has widely influenced the direction of design.

The big red flag with this card is in regards to Microsoft's reorganization.  With such a strong, divine figure at the center of this, it does imply a sense of infallibility - that they are always going to be purely themselves - even to a fault.  Switching organizational structures is not an overnight affair, and a good number of experts on the issue are pessimistic that the impact is going to be felt in any reasonable timeframe.

---------------------------------------

##### Card 2 - The Problem - Ace of Wands (inverted)
<aside class="tarot inverted pull-right">
![Ace of Wands, Inverted](/img/tarot-feature/cards/ace-of-wands.jpg "tarot")
</aside>

Opposing the issue, providing the central struggle, is the ace of wands.  This card represents ingenuity and creation - a divine gift...in it's normal state, but it's inverted, so it implies that these gifts have been overindulged and squandered.  Inverted, this card represents decay.

While decay is talked about a lot in reference to the company's increasing irrelevance, the overindulgence that got them there is talked about less.  For most of the 90's, they were perfectly happy to abuse their cash-cow, Windows, to squash the competitors to both Windows and peripheral products their web browser, Internet Explorer.

The fact that they crushed Netscape, is due in no small part to the fact that they directly integrated Internet Explorer code into their windowing and file system.  In the short term, this provide gains in performance and features, but ultimately this proved to be a horrible mistake as it helped create the wealth of security issues that bogged the company down for years.  It also made the underlying code very difficult to change and update, which eventually resulted in IE falling behind competing browser platforms like Firefox and Webkit.

Fast forward to the Surface, and the tables have turned slightly.  Instead of using Windows to bolster the product, instead it seemed like they were attempting to use the hyped product to modernize Windows.  

By equivocating in this manner, they are bound by their past, and unwilling to cut ties with it even when the market is clearly suggesting an opposite approach.  Why is this?

---------------------------------------

##### Card 3 - Root Cause - Ace of Cups
<aside class="tarot pull-right">
![Ace of Cups](/img/tarot-feature/cards/ace-of-cups.jpg "tarot")
</aside>

This card complements the Ace of Wands nicely.  The Ace of Cups represents abundance and fertility - their cup runneth over.  But this is attempting to explain the problem, not show any futures.  Microsoft attempted to rely on their past success to grow. Rather than taking a risk of failure, they assumed that Windows would always nourish the company.  But will it?

---------------------------------------

##### Card 4 - The Past - Knight of Wands
<aside class="tarot pull-right">
![Knight of Wands](/img/tarot-feature/cards/knight-of-wands.jpg "tarot")
</aside>

This card shows a knight, not dressed for battle, meekly riding away from something, holding a stick.  It represents departure or fleeing, and I'd take this to represent a person.  Could this represent the departure of Bill Gates?  

Say what you want to about Bill Gates, but the man seemed to always understand where the opportunity was.  Why do people always talk about Tim Cook vs Steve Jobs, but never Steve Balmer vs Bill Gates?  This is a legitimate question - and I think the answer lies in the fact that no one seems to actually like Steve Ballmer or want him to succeed.  I do wonder how Bill Gates would've engineered the interface for Surface, still at the top of Microsoft.  Would the company still have this intractable addiction to Windows, or would they be working on a switch in architecture - something Apple has done three times in the past 15 years.

My guess is no, this card represents a figure *fleeing*, not departing.  I think Bill Gates understood this was inevitable, and that he didn't have the power to help.  So he moved on to his foundation, where he could instead release [mosquitoes on to people at a Ted Talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppDWD3VwxVg).

---------------------------------------

##### Card 5 - Immediate Future - The Tower (inverted)
<aside class="tarot inverted pull-right">
![The Tower, Inverted](/img/tarot-feature/cards/the-tower.jpg "tarot")
</aside>

I'M SO SORRY YOU GUYS.  THIS IS ACTUALLY RANDOM.  I could've demonstrated this method without having to rely on literally the worst card in the Tarot.  The tower represents failure, destruction, and ruin, straight up.  In its inverted state it means the same thing, but you know its coming.  Basically this card is saying that everyone in Microsoft knows that they're doomed to failure and they're just waiting for it to arrive.

It does raise the core question - what is Microsoft's value to modern world?  If it's just legacy support for all the Microsoft products out there - what we should expect to see are a series of abbreviated large drops downward in marketshare as enterprises refresh their fleets of machines.

This is already happening in the retail space, with small businesses replacing their PC-based (and frankly ugly) POS solutions with iPads running POS software like Square.  POS hardware, from Microsoft's perspective, is likely a very low margin market and not necessarily on their radar, but what was on their radar when they were developing Surface?  Did Microsoft focus on Apple too much when creating the Surface?  A number of the features, like the keyboards and the use of a filesystem, seem to directly and intentionally oppose iOS and the iPad.  A device built solely for the intention of competing, but without any customers in mind.

---------------------------------------

##### Card 6 - The future - Five of pentacles (inverted)
<aside class="tarot inverted pull-right">
![Five of Pentacles, inverted](/img/tarot-feature/cards/five-of-pentacles.jpg "tarot")
</aside>

Urrrgh. Discord and ruin - peasants walking away from a church in a snowstorm.  This is really bad card to pull in this spot, and disastrous to pull along with The Tower.  It's hard not to look at the peasants depicted and envision laid off workers.  I am curious about these workers, because I don't know what successes the company is building its future around.  If you had to shed weight from the company - where would you shed it and what would you focus on?

These first six cards paint a very clear picture of a company that failed to innovate through its success.  The inverted tower does imply that they've seen it coming for some time, but the plethora of wealth-related cards means that the failure to progress really hasn't harmed the company all that much...yet.  These last two cards do imply that there luck may change in the near future, and we may start seeing the cracks in the company foundations start to show themselves.

---------------------------------------

##### Card 7 - You, in the present - Nine of wands
<aside class="tarot pull-right">
![Nine of Wands](/img/tarot-feature/cards/nine-of-wands.jpg "tarot")
</aside>

This card represents fortifying before a battle.  Microsoft is prepared for battle, and still a formidable opponent, or at least that's how they see themselves.  I tend to think this represents Microsoft's attitude for quite a while now.  They've been ready to bring the battle and to fight any over market.  The problem is that they arrive after the fight is already over.

The figure in this card is well stocked for battle, but over what... and why?  This is really the big question surrounding Microsoft right now - okay, you guys can bring the fight, but do you actually know where the fight is and where you plan to innovate?  

[This piece from Anil Dash](http://dashes.com/anil/2013/08/a-brief-history-of-apples-iwatch.html) comes to mind, it seems like the expectation from Microsoft is that they'll arrive late with a product that might have been innovative a year ago.

---------------------------------------

##### Card 8 - You, as the world sees you - The devil (inverted)
<aside class="tarot inverted pull-right">
![The Devil, inverted](/img/tarot-feature/cards/the-devil.jpg "tarot")
</aside>

The Devil inverted, isn't as bad as it looks, especially in this situation.  The devil represents vice and addiction - all of the stuff we talked about above with Microsoft's legacy.  Inverted, it represents that you've repented or overcome that darkness.

As Microsoft worked through Windows 8 and the Surface, we all were all willing to forgive to some extent.  Some tech bloggers went even further, portraying Microsoft as the underdog and Apple as the evil giant - a total role reversal.

---------------------------------------

##### Card 9 - Key Factor / Hopes and dreams - Knight of swords (inverted)
<aside class="tarot inverted pull-right">
![Knight of Swords, inverted](/img/tarot-feature/cards/knight-of-swords.jpg "tarot")
</aside>

This card represents bravery and righteousness - a knight riding into battle.  But inverted, it suggests that the cause is hopeless, and to some extent that the knight is on a fool's errand or too arrogant to see the error of the cause.

I tend to look a this card in connection with the nine of wands, another card dealing with battle.  It reinforces the notion that to some extent, Microsoft doesn't understand how to properly compete in the modern world.

---------------------------------------

##### Card 10 - Ultimate outcome - Two of wands inverted
<aside class="tarot inverted pull-right">
![Two of Wands, inverted](/img/tarot-feature/cards/two-of-wands.jpg "tarot")
</aside>

This card shows a man waiting on the shore for a person or riches, but to some extent it implies that the riches may not ever arrive.  The reverse meaning implies some self-awareness of this, and that ultimately while it might not arrive, there may be more surprises and excitement in store.

The cards here paint an unambiguous picture - a huge and legitimate empire, represented by the Magician, surrounded by calamity and ruin and preparing for a final battle that they've already lost.  The interesting thing about this last card is that it suggests that the company will live on, but as sort of a dreamer in exile.  

Microsoft's boat isn't coming, but we may continue to see interesting and innovative things out of the company, even if they aren't truly successful (the Metro UI and the Kinect are two recent things that come to mind).

---------------------------------------

### Okay - do you see what we did there?

Let's discuss some of the key points.

The presence of Bill Gates as the fleeing Knight of Wands was quite fascinating to me.  We, in the tech community spend so much time talking about Steve Ballmer that we often stop short of asking the question - who's the emotional and intellectual leader of the company?  Ballmer is the lead bully, but given that they're trying to compete with companies like Google and Apple, that's not enough.  Those competing companies have true pioneers and heavyweights at the top.

Microsoft as the Magician was also a very interesting card.  The Magician, in its upright form, is one of the powerful cards in the deck.  It casts a great shadow across the rest of the cards played, because it sets up Microsoft not as a bunch of bumbling fools, but as a massive, talented power center in tech. I  think it represents what any tech company wants to achieve.  Well, everyone except Zynga.

I did expect to get some cards that could be taken negatively, but wasn't expecting to get bashed over the head with it with the Tower and Five of Pentacles. Those may have been the two worst cards to pull in the whole deck.  They're basically an obituary for the company.  This raises one of the ways that this method can be useful - addressing the elephant in the room more explicitly.
