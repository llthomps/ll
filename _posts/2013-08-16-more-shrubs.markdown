I've been playing a bit with shrubs since the [last post]({% post_url 2013-07-30-shrubs %}), and wanted to share one new recipe and one update to an earlier recipe we'd highlighted.

### Hatch Chile Shrub

+ 1 cup, chopped hatch chile peppers (hot) or poblano peppers
+ 1 cup, white sugar
+ &frac34;, cup of champagne vinegar

Chop the chile peppers, and cram them into a measuring cup.  Combine in a container with the sugar, agitate, and let sit for 2-3 days, until all the sugar has gone into solution.  Agitate 1-2 times / day.  Strain the liquid into a bowl or large measuring cup and combine with the vinegar.  Store and enjoy!

Unlike most fruits, chiles will have oils, so be sure to agitate the shrub before using to emulsify the oils into the rest of the shrub.

##### Margarita

+ &frac12; oz, hatch chile shrub
+ 2 oz, blanco tequila (el jimador)
+ 3 dashes, orange bitters

Stir and serve over ice.

### Strawberry Habanero Coffee Shrub

This "really bad idea" from the last post turned out to be an amazing idea.  The flavors in this shrub are off the charts - think chocolate and roasted strawberries.  Here's the recipe we used:

+ 1 cup, chopped strawberries
+ &frac14; cup, chopped habanero peppers
+ 1 cup, brown sugar
+ 2 oz, finely ground coffee
+ &frac23; cup, unfiltered Apple Cider Vinegar

Combine the chopped strawberries, peppers, sugar and coffee in a container and seriously agitate / mix.  Let the mixture sit for 2-3 days, agitating 1-2 times / day, until all the sugar has gone into solution.  You'll need to strain this through a very fine sieve to get all the coffee grounds out (I'm still experimenting with the best way to do this).  You may need to strain multiple times.  Let this shrub rest at least 1 week to let the vinegar mellow out.  This shrub can be tweaked to add more habanero peppers, as the amount used will give a roasty, spciy flavor but not much bite.  The amount of coffee used will seem like a lot, but keep the ratio intact!  You're essentially making a cold brew and using not enough coffee will make the mixture bitter, as opposed to sweet and chocolatey.

##### "Smart Patrol"

+ &frac12; oz, strawberry habanero coffee shrub
+ 2 oz, rye or bourbon
+ 2-3 dashes, of Angostura bitters
+ 1 Luxardo cherry

Shake the shrub and bourbon and serve up (in a stemmed glass) with the cherry and bitters.  Strain out the ice chunks, please, as you pour into the glass.
