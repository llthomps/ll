If you’re like me and scour the internet for multiple recipes to sort of “frankenrecipe”, I highly recommend this book. I just picked up a copy today, and haven’t put it down (I accidentally glued it to my pants).

This cookbook has no recipes, instead opting for 339 pages of what it calls “Flavor Matchmaking Charts” - an alphabetical list of every ingredient and a companion list of things that complement the ingredient, as well as useful advice from chefs. So, instead of asking “can I substitute ingredient X” and trying to find someone who agrees with you on foodnetwork.com, you can just look it up in the damn book.

Interestingly, as seen above, more complementary ingredients get more weight and capitalization, so lavender goes great with **HONEY** and **LAMB**.
