preview: Why should anything be simple? In this article, we’ll cover the most base topic and try and understand how people make a decision to buy a particular pair of shoes. Specifically, we’ll be looking at how the BRAIN facilitates the decision, the three layers of decision processing, and where we get confused and start making stupid decisions. Who’s down for some stupid decisions with me?

First things first, I need to come clean about to everyone. My name is Lloyd Thompson, and over the past two years, I’ve gone from owning a single pair of Justin cowboy boots and some beat up sketchers to a compulsive shoe shopper. I&#8217;m not going to start throwing out dollar amounts, but suffice to say its enough that I&#8217;ve had to invest in a custom storage solution, and when I run out of room I have to donate shoes to the goodwill. To those of you who don&#8217;t buy shoes a lot, you now know my/this secret. To those of you who do - fuck yeah, let&#8217;s go buy some cowboy boots RIGHT NOW. Call me.

This is relevant because a few months ago, I had the opportunity to conduct some research on how and why people buy shoes. I conducted interviews, spent (more) time on shoe shopping sites, and even spent hours watching people try on and buy shoes. I came up with a number of earth shattering insights, all of which I’ll share in a later article, about why and how people buy shoes. More importantly, it helped clue me in on what the hell I was doing - something I’d earnestly been confused about (i.e. - “I just bought three pairs of shoes, why did I do that?”).

In this article, I’ll cover the most base topic and try and understand how people  make a decision to buy a particular pair of shoes. Specifically, we’ll be looking at how the BRAIN facilitates the decision. The HUMAN BRAIN operates through three distinct processing centers, and the way this maps to something fairly granular like shoe shopping is really, really awesome if you like buying shoes. If this doesn’t interest you, here’s a video of the cast of [He-Man singing 4 Non Blondes](http://heyyeyaaeyaaaeyaeyaa.com).

#### The three domains of processing and purchasing

One way to think about the brain is to think about it in terms of [processing centers](http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/CH01.pdf) - layers that interpret the world for us in distinct ways and reflect our evolutionary history as a species.

</aside>

The first domain is the visceral domain where we size up the physical and aesthetic characteristics of a shoe. This is partially our biology at work, but it’s also our first pass at identifying beauty. Beautiful things have organic shapes to them, they have colors and textures that identify their characteristics in easy to understand ways, and they are distinct and unique. In my own personal experience, a strong visceral reaction is one that requires a moment of quiet to fully absorb - where we wait for the words to arrive.

The second domain is a personal or emotional domain. Almost instantaneously after a shoe catches our eye, we get a similar assessment of how relevant that shoe is to us. Does it reinforce our self-image? Does it match our clothes? Is it what we came here looking for? Most importantly, we understand the situation we’re going to wear that shoe in. A work shoe vs. a party shoe vs. a winter boot - we don’t need really need to think about those things, we just get it based on our experience.

Before we move on to the third, and final, domain - I want to make clear that these first two domains are processed largely unconsciously and almost instantaneously. That is to say, we’re not necessarily aware that they’re happening, and we’re not necessarily capable of taking advantage of their assessment, as in the case of making a purchase, they don&#8217;t always arrive to us with a clear action in mind, because the action requires a mental follow-up.

One of the key differentiators between expert and novice shoe shoppers seemed to be the comfort level involved in translating these first two domains of processing into actionable data points for the third domain - the fun part where we make the decision.

The third domain is a reflective and logical domain of processing. The logical domain gets to sort out everything else. Given infinite processing resources and all of the available information, it could probably do this, but it has neither of these. First, we don’t know the entire history of the shoe, the company and all of the variables involved in shoe manufacturing and resale and even if we did the brain can only juggle a few variables at a time (between 4 and 9, based on various sources<sup>[1]</sup>). Complicating matters is the possibility that our visceral and emotional verdict was tainted by some external factor, like display lighting, glossy leather or a photoshopped online photo.

We deal with all this complexity in two ways.

<span id="section2"> </span>
#### Verification

The first is to verify that instantaneous understanding of the shoe. Our interviews provided some interesting insight into how this happens. When people talked to us, they frequently used two words - “quality” and “comfort”, but in different contexts. Sometimes when people talked about quality - they were talking about the texture and the color or the look of the leather - these are visceral elements. Other times, they were talking about the thickness of the leather, and the stitching or the sole - these are quite practical considerations of how long we expect the shoe to last. So, using this data, we can say that by examining “quality” - we’re actually logically evaluating our visceral understanding of the shoe.

The same holds true for comfort - sometimes the interview subject would talk about comfort in terms of fit and shape, but really what they ultimately came back to was how long they thought they could wear it and how well that matched up to situation they imagined using the shoe in. Work shoes need to be worn all day, but a shoe for a party only needs to be worn for a few hours and comfort is an evaluation of whether or not the shoe could be used for the specified period of time. In this sense, comfort is actually a measure of time, not of how comfortable something is, and this time allows us to logically evaluate whether or not this shoe is actually personally relevant to our situation.

#### Strategy

<aside class='pull pull-right'>
<h5>Biases in decision making : sizing vs fit</h5>

<p>Sometimes when we're making a decision we consider incorrect data or weigh particular elements of a decision improperly.  When we do this, we’re exhibiting a bias.  We found two biases around sizing - one bias we encountered was the notion that if two different styles of the same brand shoe have different fits (you wear size 11 in one and size 10.5 in the other) that it indicates poor manufacturing quality.  Shoes are hand assembled on “lasts” - models of a foot - and those lasts are what the size is determined from.  If you use a different last for a different style (heels vs flats), you may get a different fit and require a different size.</p>
<p>In this case, the bias is rooted in the assumption that size is a characteristic of our foot - “I’m a size 11”.  This is incorrect - the model used to make most of your shoes is a size 11, and your foot is in irregularly sized approximatation of a “normal” foot.</p>

</div>

<p>The second bias we encountered was a striking preference for whole numbers in sizing, shown on the graph to the right.  While it's difficult to know the reasons this trend exists, it suggests that either human feet grow naturally into even whole number segments on an arbirtrary scale or that a great deal of ignorance over sizing and impies that a good deal of Americans are wearing ill-fitted shoes.  Past research rules out the former, so it's probably the latter.</p>
<p>Try on multiple sizes!</p>
</aside>

The second part of getting through the complexity involves strategy selection. There are still too many shoes and too many variables for most people to realistically deal with, so we need to eliminate some of the options. We do this in a number of ways:

*   Brand bias - we’re more likely to go with a brand we already know and like. Sometimes we even pre-select the brand ahead of time. Think Frye boots. Similarly, we can have very negative impression of brands, depending on the type of people who typically wear them. Sperry Top Siders are quite controversial.
*   Fashion bias - we haven’t spent much time talking about society’s role in evaluation and purchasing, but it’s obviously a major player. Square-toed shoes and flip-flops (on men) scored very negatively among our interview subjects, despite very little personal experience with them.
*   Budgets - a budget can work in both direction. Shoppers can have lower limits and upper limits to their purchases.
*   Social shopping - when we bring a friend or consult a sales-person, we can offload some of the thinking to them. Not having to deal with things like cost and selection, they can help us put words to feelings that we have. They can also provide us with social reinforcement. This all assumes that we trust their judgement.

When all else fails, we can hit overload. When we max out and can’t juggle the variables anymore, sometimes we just make a yes or no decision - based on pressure or exhaustion - or the last factor we examined. Sometimes it’s a good one, sometimes not. While you don’t want to make decisions this way, it’s largely part of being human. Just try buying peanut butter at the Whole Foods for the first time.

#### What is the value of your favorite shoes?

What we&#8217;re trying to determine out of all this is some sense of overall value. A big part of it is price, but I&#8217;d argue that price is just another possible bias, unless we&#8217;re comparing it against something at which point it becomes the final gateway between the logical part of our brain and the final decision. At the end of the day, we end up with a shoe or shoes (add-on purchases seemed to be quite common), how happy we are with these shoes is based on how successful we were in translating our visceral and emotional signals into an action. The favorite shoes of the people we talked were the ones that matched up to their intended situations the best and also expressed a very personal aesthetic.

So, when you&#8217;re shoe shopping, take some time and try and figure out what you&#8217;re attracted to before you start worrying and focusing on making a decision. Chances are you&#8217;ll end up with more adventurous choices, a better experience and hopefully some compliments.

_Up next..._

If we continue to explore this topic more, we’ll look at some of the personas people adopt when they purchase shoes. These personas will help describe how frequently people buy shoes, what types of shoes they’re likely to buy, and some of the shopping strategies they use.
