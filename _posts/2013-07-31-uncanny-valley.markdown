Generally, when we hear about the uncanny valley - itâ€™s someone talking about Zombies, Polar Express or a freaky japanese robot face. Translate - someone is trying to gross us out or they kinda fucked up. Artist Mike Pelletier has taken a different approach, attempting to dive in and out of the valley - creating things that are varying level of bothersome.

The uncanny valley describes an effect where humans can accept and respond positively to anthropomorphic forms up to a point. But when those forms start to get too close, our level of acceptance drops dramatically, and we can respond very negatively.
