One of the best UX books I've read this year, is [Make it So : Interaction Design Lessons from Science Fiction (Rosenfeld Media)](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/make-it-so/).  This incredible book takes the approach of examining the interfaces in science fiction movies as if they are fully functional, draws assumptions about what _must_ be making them work (or not work) correctly for a user and returns those assumptions as distilled insights.

Through this process, the authors highlight the role that successful interaction designers play in developing a narrative for the users to follow.

The Make it So blog released a few new articles spotlighting [Ghost in the Shell (1995)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113568/).
